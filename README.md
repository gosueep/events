# EventsApp

Hosted in Google Cloud Platform, we built a REST API for our app to update our database in real-time. 
API: (for proof) https://events-app-v3xfr7jk4q-uc.a.run.app 
Our database was also hosted in GCP and we used Google Cloud Run as a serverless compute solution that only runs when needed, saving us money.
